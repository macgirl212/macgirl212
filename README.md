- 👋 Hi, I’m @macgirl212. I have been coding for barely a year now.
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development and making things look cool. Be prepared for a lot of variety of themes in my projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and D3. I'm also starting out in Node, Express, and MongoDB. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is open to input from an up-and-coming full-stack developer.
- 📫 How to reach me... That's still a work in progress, but in the meantime, feel free to check out my codepen. https://codepen.io/macgirl212
